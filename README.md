# Housing-price-prediction
Predict housing prices using linear regression. Explore data, train model, evaluate performance, and visualize results in Python.
This project focuses on predicting housing prices using linear regression.

## Overview

The project utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. It employs the scikit-learn library to implement linear regression modeling. The goal is to predict housing prices based on the area of the house.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Model training: Training a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
- Performance evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using mean squared error.
- Visualization: Visualizing the relationship between housing prices and areas through scatter plots and regression lines.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
